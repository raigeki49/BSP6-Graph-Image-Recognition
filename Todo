Make a function that returns a list containing all the neighbors of a pixel (just for a cleaner code since it's used several times)


Important: Do not call your class Object or use object as a variable name, it has a special role in python (base class of everything)


Preliminary report:
1) Project Description 
2) Explain that we focus on simple graphs, doing a home-made algorithm 
3) Two steps : identifying objects then identifying structure
4) Explain algorithm to identify objects
5) Explain algorithm to extract structure assuming we know what is an edge/vertex (= knowing pixel color)
6) Explain algorithm to identify vertex/edges (detecting circles and edge-splitting)
7) (Maybe not yet ? unless need a more stuff to write) Explain how we verify if the result is correct
