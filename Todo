
Goals for OpenCV parsing:

1) How do we detect lines and circles with openCV
1.1) Getting coordinates of the pixels in each detected object (?)
1.2) Add visualization of the detected circle/lines

- Mini-tutorial on openCV ? Explain (some of) the parameters (for example).

First we can assume planar graph, no intersecting edges etc. 
2) Determine which circles (= vertices) are connected to each other with a line (= edge)
   -> Worst case, can probably just check pixel coordinates to see which ones are next to each other


Then we are going to allow more stuff for the graph picture, and look for solutions to handle it
- Edges can touch near the vertices (like when we needed edge-splitting)
  => Do we need to do anything to handle this ? 

- Allow non-planar graphs (but still straight lines edges)
  => How to detect intersections between two edges (if need) and get the resulting lines

Main objective: Parse an image obtained by taking a picture of a graph on the whiteboard


============================================================


- What if edges are not straight lines, but zigzag lines ?

- Could we use this to solve (wire) labyrinths ?


XX) What if edges are not straight lines (curvy lines) ?

XX) Bonus objective:
What if the whole graph is only one color (both vertices and edges are the same color) ?
